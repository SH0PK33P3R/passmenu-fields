# Passmenu Fields ðŸŒ±

_Passmenu Fields is an extention for the [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) password manager._<br /><br />
It displays your pass files in dmenu, including a click-through menu for sub-fields, and copies the contents to the clipboard, providing a fast and convenient way of using credentials saved within pass.

## Prerequisites

- xclip
- dmenu
- pass

## Setup

- add the `passmenu-fields` executable to your $PATH (and optionally configure it to execute with a keyboard shortcut)
- make sure your gpg files are ordered + structured like this:

```

## Todo
